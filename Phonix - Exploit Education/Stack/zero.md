# Stack Zero
[Challenge Link](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-zero/)
## Solving the challenge:
Basic Stack buffer overflow.

The first variable buffer has 64 chars, and the next variable changeme is an `int`.

The porgram uses `gets`, which is well known for it's problem with entering data, it just writes the data it have to the tack without limiting itself to the variable's limit.

Entering a string with more than 64 chars causes the variable next to the `buffer` variable to be over-written.

 - Exploit used:

Python: `python -c 'print "A"*68'`

- PS: when using python to generate input (especially in `gdb`), we use `r <<< $(python ...)` so the output from the python print will be used as the input for the program.
