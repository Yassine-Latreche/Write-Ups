# Stack One
[Challenge Link](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-one/)
## Solving the challenge:
Basic Stack buffer overflow, with a specified value to be written (chars).

The same thing from the last challenge applies here, except that the program tests for a certain value, which is `0x496c5962` to be exact.

Converting the value from hex to ascii gives us the next string `IlYb`, but we know that amd64/x86 processors are `Little-endian`, which means the data is stored in reverse.

Knowing that, the correct string will be: `bYlI`.

 - Exploit used:

Python: `python -c 'print "A"*64 + "bYlI"'`

- PS: when using python to generate input (especially in `gdb`), we use `r <<< $(python ...)` so the output from the python print will be used as the input for the program.
